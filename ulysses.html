		<h2>Why I Like This Book</h2>
		<p>For those who are unaware, Ulysses is a retelling of the Homer's Greek poem <i>The Odyssey.</i> It is a story that takes place during a single day on June 16th, 1904 in Dublin, Ireland. Each chapter, or episode, takes place over roughly an hour. For example, Episode 1 is from 8:00am to 9:00am and then Episode 2 is from 9:00am to 10:00am and so forth. There are exceptions, but the point is that this novel is an indepth look at the life of Leopold Bloom, the protagonist, over a single day.</p>
		<h3 style="font: sans-serif;">Why You Should Read This Book</h3>
		<p> The book is highly experimental, and utilizes complex literary techniques which has given the book a reputation as one of the most difficult novels ever written. While I will not try to downplay the difficulty of this book (I found myself getting lost many times), it is one of the most rewarding reading experiences I have ever had. It is a beautiful examination on the beauty of life, the intricacy of human relationships, the versatility of langugage, and how our boring and ordinary lives are actually extrodinary. I cannot reccomend this book enough.</p>

		<p style="font-family:courier;"> If you would like to attempt the book, I would actually reccomend skipping the first 3 episodes and going to Episode 4. The reason why is I believe this to be the "true" start of the book. It also introduces the reader to Leopold Bloom, who is a wonderful character in my opinion.

		<p style="font-family:courier"> If you don't wish to stomach the entire book (I wouldn't blame you), I would at least reccomend reading Episode 17. It's an episode that's written entirely in question and answer format, and has some of the most beautiful sentences written in the English language.

		<p style="font-family: courier"> And the most important thing to keep in mind is that it is okay if you get stuck! It is okay to look up a summary of the chapter and to figure out what is going on. And finally, it is okay to not force yourself to read a book that you do not find interesting.
